## PSG-Macro
Macro for the Perfect Seed Glitchless category extension. Download [PSG MAP](https://github.com/BlockOfNetherite/PSG/releases) and join the [UCE Discord](https://discord.gg/CxGBhFQ2mR)

Default hotkeys:

U: Reset when in a world

I: Reset on title screen

O: Datapack list

P: Perch
## Installation
*if you downloaded a newer version you only need to replace the macro*
1. Install [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Unzip the folder and *dont take anything out of it*
3. In your minecraft world list search up "PSG" and if any worlds pop up delete/rename them
4. Set your saves directory, oldWorlds directory and configure other macro options
## Using a different world
The folder that you get when you unzip contains 3 files, if you want to use a different world make sure that you replace PerfectWorld in the folder with it. After that, rename the file (inside the psgmacro folder) to exactly PerfectWorld
## FAQ
Q:My worlds aren't moving!

A: Make sure you properly set your saves and oldworlds folder, also make sure your oldworlds folder exists. If its still not working delete everything in your oldWorlds folder. If that still didnt fix it dm me on discord

Q: F3 doesnt show when I load into a world for the first time!

A: This is a known issue, but it's so rare and unessecary that I won't fix it because then all resets will be sacrficed for one

Q: Why does it always join the oldWorld?

A: Read the installation tab

If you have any more rarer issues dm me on discord fikiskill#9693
