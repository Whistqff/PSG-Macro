## PSG-Macro
Macro for the Perfect Seed Glitchless category extension
## Installation
*if you downloaded a newer version you only need to replace the macro*
1. Install [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Unzip the folder and *dont take anything out of it*
3. In your minecraft world list search up "PSG" and if any worlds pop up delete/rename them
4. Configure the options inside the macro
## Using a different world
The folder that you get when you unzip contains 3 files, if you want to use a different world make sure that you replace PerfectWorld in the folder with it. Make sure it has the same name and make sure the minecraft title has "PSG" in the name.
