## PSG-Macro
Macro for the Perfect Seed Glitchless category extension. And if you want to, join the [UCE Discord](https://discord.gg/CxGBhFQ2mR) here

Default hotkeys:

U: Reset

O: Datapack list

P: Perch

To change just scroll down to the bottom of the script and replace the hotkeys there
## Installation
*if you downloaded a newer version you only need to replace the macro*
1. Install [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Download sourcecode.zip from releases and then extract it `don't take anything out of it`
3. In your minecraft world list search up "PSG" and if any worlds pop up delete/rename them
4. Download [PSG MAP](https://github.com/BlockOfNetherite/PSG/releases/latest) and extract it to its own directory, then rename the folder as "PerfectWorld"
5. Set your saves directory, oldWorlds directory and configure other macro options
## TroubleShooting
Q: Why worlds aren't moving?

A: Make sure you properly set your saves folder(make sure to NOT put a backslash at the end), also make sure your oldworlds folder exists. If its still not working delete everything in your oldWorlds folder. If that still didnt fix it dm me on discord

Q: Why won't f3 show when i load into a world for the first time?

A: This is a known issue, but it's so rare and unessecary that I won't fix it because then all resets will be sacrficed for one

Q: Why does it always join the oldWorld?

A: Read the installation tab

If you have any more rarer issues dm fiki on discord fikiskill#9693 or if you're having problems with my fork dm Whistqff#7006.
